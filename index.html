            <h2>What is the Course About?</h2>
            <p>The "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" course explores foundational techniques for designing algorithms and analyzing their efficiency in solving computational problems. It focuses on understanding algorithmic paradigms like divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy methods while emphasizing real-world applications.</p>

            <h2>What Data Structures and Algorithms Have You Studied?</h2>
            <p>This course covers essential data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. Algorithms like sorting (merge sort, quick sort), searching (binary search), shortest path (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford), and minimum spanning tree (Prim's, Kruskal's) are studied to enhance problem-solving skills.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Connecting the Course with Real-Time Applications</h2>
            <p>The concepts learned are directly applicable to real-world scenarios, such as optimizing network routing, designing search engines, improving database indexing, and creating efficient software solutions. For instance, graph algorithms are used in Google Maps for navigation, while dynamic programming solves complex optimization problems in resource management.</p>
